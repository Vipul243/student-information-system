Student Information System
A comprehensive Java-based application designed to manage student records, courses, and grades with a user-friendly graphical interface and persistent data storage.

Project Overview
The Student Information System is an educational management solution that demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming concepts while providing practical functionality for academic administration. The system allows for efficient management of student data, course information, and grade records through an intuitive GUI interface backed by MongoDB for data persistence.

Key Technologies
Java 11: Core programming language with OOP principles
Swing: GUI framework for the desktop application interface
MongoDB: NoSQL database for persistent data storage
Maven: Dependency management and build automation
MongoDB Java Driver: Integration layer between Java and MongoDB
Object-Oriented Programming Features
Classes and Objects: Modular design with specialized classes
Inheritance: Multilevel inheritance with Person → Student → GraduateStudent
Polymorphism: Method overriding for specialized behavior
Encapsulation: Private fields with getter/setter methods
Interfaces: GradeCalculator interface implementation
Method Overloading: Multiple constructors and methods with different parameters
Static Members: Class variables and methods for global tracking

Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher
MongoDB server installed and running (default: localhost:27017)
Maven (for dependency management)
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository
Ensure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
Build the project using Maven or the provided start script
How to Run
Using the Start Script (Recommended)
On macOS or Linux:

chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
The script automatically checks for MongoDB, builds the project with Maven, and launches the application.

Using Maven
Navigate to the project root directory
Build the project:
mvn clean package
Run the application:
java -jar target/student-information-system-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Using an IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
Import the project as a Maven project
Build the project
Run either the Main class (for console version) or MainFrame class (for GUI version)
Database Configuration
By default, the application connects to a MongoDB server running on localhost:27017. You can modify the connection settings in MongoDBConnection.java.

The system uses the following MongoDB collections:

students: Stores student information
courses: Stores course information
Class Descriptions
Domain Classes
Person
Base class with basic person attributes (name, age, address)
Has constructors, getters/setters and a displayInfo() method
Student
Extends Person and implements GradeCalculator
Adds student-specific attributes (studentId, department)
Manages course enrollment and grades
Implements grade calculation methods
GraduateStudent
Extends Student (forming multilevel inheritance)
Adds graduate-specific attributes (researchArea, supervisor, thesis status)
Overrides grade calculation methods with stricter grading policies
Course
Contains course information (id, name, instructor, credits)
Includes static variable to track total number of courses
GradeCalculator
Interface defining methods for grade calculation
Implemented by Student class
Database Classes
MongoDBConnection: Singleton class to manage database connection
StudentRepository: Handles CRUD operations for students
CourseRepository: Handles CRUD operations for courses
GUI Classes

MainFrame: Main application window with tabbed interface

StudentPanel: Panel for student management
CoursePanel: Panel for course management
GradePanel: Panel for grade management
